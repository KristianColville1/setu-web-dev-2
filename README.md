## Overview

This repository documents the iterative development of the WeatherTop website assignment.

Development follows a structured, branch-based workflow, progressing from initial Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) to full Releases. Each phase is tracked with dedicated branches and clear, incremental commits.

## Git Workflow

Typical commands for managing branches:

```bash
git checkout -b branch_name
git push --set-upstream origin branch_name
git checkout main
git pull origin branch_name
git push origin main
```

## Development Strategy

The assignment is delivered in multiple iterations:

- **Baseline**
- **Release 1** â†’ **Release 3**
- **Release 4** and beyond (if time permits)

Key practices:

- Initialize with a robust project foundation.
- Create a new branch for each POC and Release, following assignment guidelines.
- Build each stage on the previous, ensuring commits are focused and meaningful.
- Use **Express.js** with **Handlebars** for templating, **Bulma** for styling, and a clear **MVC architecture** in JavaScript.
- Host the Node.js app on **Render**.

## Development & Deployment

### Version Control

I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a local repository and IDE & [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a remote repository.

1. Firstly, I needed to create a new repository on Github [setu-web-dev-2](https://github.com/KristianColville1/setu-web-dev-2).
2. I opened that repository on my local machine by copying the URL from that repository and cloning it from my IDE for use.
3. Visual Studio Code opened a new workspace for me.
4. I created files and folders to use.
5. To push my newly created files to GitHub I used the terminal by pressing Ctrl + shift + `.
6. A new terminal opened and then I used the below steps.

   - `git add (name of the file)` *This selects the file for the commit*
   - `git commit -m "Commit message: (i.e. Initial commit)"` *Allows the developer to assign a specific concise statement to the commit*
   - `git push` *The final command sends the code to GitHub*

### Cloning this Repository

If you would like to clone this repository please follow the bellow steps.

Instructions:

1. Log into GitHub.
2. Go to the repository you wish to clone.
3. Click the green "Code" button.
4. Copy the URL provided under the HTTPS option.
5. Open your preferred IDE with Git installed.
6. Open a new terminal window in your IDE.
7. Enter the following command exactly: `git clone the-URL-you-copied-from-GitHub`.
8. Press Enter.

### Render

I used [Render](https://render.com/) for deploying my project.

1. First, I created an account on [Render](https://render.com/).
2. I connected my GitHub repository to Render by clicking the "New Web Service" button on the Render dashboard.
3. I selected "Web Service" and authorized Render to access my GitHub account.
4. I chose the repository I wanted to deploy from the list of available options.
5. I specified the start command (e.g. `node app.js` or your main server file).
6. I set the appropriate environment variables if required (such as `PORT`).
7. After confirming the settings, I clicked "Create Web Service."
8. Render then started building and deploying the project, and once finished, it provided a URL for accessing the live site.

Render also automatically sets up continuous deployment. Any new changes pushed to the main repository will trigger a new deployment on Render.
